        Timothy "Tim" John Berners-Lee ( London , UK , 8 of June of 1955 ), known as Tim Berners-Lee , a computer scientist British, known as the father of the World Wide Web . He established the first communication between a client and a server using the HTTP protocol in December 1990. In October 1994 he founded the World Wide Web Consortium ( W3C ) based at MIT , to monitor and standardize the development of technologies on those on which the Web is based and that allow the operation ofInternet .<br>
            Faced with the need to distribute and exchange information about his research in a more effective way, Berners-Lee developed the fundamental ideas that structure the web. He and his team created what for its acronym in English is called language HTML ( H yper T ext M arkup L anguage ) or markup language hypertext protocol HTTP ( H yper T ext T ransfer P rotocol ) and the system location of objects on the web URL ( U niform R esource Locator ).
